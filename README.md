# Assessment Production - Item Authoring Tool

Web-based application for the creation and review of assessment items.  This repo contains the source for a greenfield implementation of the item authoring tool.  Once complete this implementation will replace the old item authoring tool.

Note, "AP" is short for Assessment Production which means the creation of assessment items (questions) and assessments (tests) for the purpose of administering those assessments to students.  All repos for libraries, services, and apps associated with assessment production are prefixed with AP.
